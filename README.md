## ⚠️ Notes

> - This circuit only works with a **5V / 2A** power supply or a **Type-C USB** connection.  
> - When powering via **Type-C from a computer**, **remove the J1 jumper** to avoid powering relays from the USB port (may cause damage).  
> - Use a **regulated and smooth power supply** for stable operation.
